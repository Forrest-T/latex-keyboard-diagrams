# Keyboard Diagram Template
I wanted to create a diagram with all of the keyboard shortcuts used in my window manager i3, but couldn't find any resources online to do it easily in LaTeX. This project is a template that can be modified to create keyboard shortcut diagrams.
# Usage
Simply modify the macros in kymacros.sty
